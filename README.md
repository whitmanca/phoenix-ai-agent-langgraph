# Phoenix Public Safety Agent (Chat Only)


A conversational AI agent built with FastAPI and LangChain and powered by Groq LLMs that provides up to date public safety information for Phoenix, Arizona. 
Helps residents stay informed about recent crime reports, emerging crime trends, and other safety resources such as FEMA's flood zone data.
This version focuses purely on text chat — no map actions or visualization hooks are included.

## Features

- Tool execution (geocoding, flood risk, etc.) when relevant
- Direct text responses when tools aren’t needed
- FastAPI backend with a /chat endpoint
